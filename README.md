# Heavenly-Chocolates-Website-Transactions-using-Statistics-and-R-language

Heavenly Chocolates would like to use the sample data to determine if online shoppers who view
more pages also spend more money during their visit to the website. They are also interested in
knowing the distribution of the time spent by the shoppers on the website. The company would
also like to investigate the effect that the day of the week and the type of browser have on sales.
